# Project Title: Dex Difference Score AI

This project is an AI-based solution designed to optimize the routing algorithm in decentralized exchanges (dexes). It achieves this by calculating the difference score between two different dexes on two different chains.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to speed up the routing algorithm by reducing the number of dex pairs it needs to go through to find the best price difference. Instead of going through 200 dex pairs, our AI algorithm narrows it down to the top 10 pairs with the highest difference score.

## Features

- AI Algorithm: The core of this project is an AI algorithm that calculates the difference score between two dexes. This score is used to rank the dex pairs and identify the ones with the highest potential for price difference.

- Historical Data Analysis: The algorithm uses historical data to calculate the difference score. This allows it to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future performance.

- Optimized Routing: By focusing on the top 10 dex pairs, the routing algorithm can find the best price difference more quickly and efficiently.
